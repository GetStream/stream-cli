# Stream Chat CLI

Stream's Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to create and manage your Stream apps directly from the terminal. Currently, only Chat is supported; however, the ability to manage Feeds will be coming soon.

# 📌 Requirements

Only Node 8+ is supported. Node 6 will reach end-of-life April 2019. At that point we will continue to support the current LTS version of node. You can add the node package to your CLI to ensure users are on Node 8.

# 🏗 Installation

The Stream CLI is easy to install. You have the option to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) (preferred) if you're on macOS, download a single binary with zero run-time dependencies for your OS of choice, or install the CLI using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/getstream-cli).

### 🍺 Homebrew (macOS only)

```sh-session
$ brew install stream
```

### 💾 Binaries

-   [Mac OS X](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-cli/releases)
-   [Linux](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-cli/releases)
-   [Windows](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-cli/releases)

> Note: Binaries are generally updated less frequently than Homebrew and NPM.

### ⏳ NPM

```sh-session
$ npm install -g getstream-cli
```

# 🚀 Getting Started

In order to initialize the CLI, please have your Stream API key and secret ready. Run the following command:

```sh-session
$ stream config:set
```

You will then be prompted to enter your API key and secret.

```sh-session
$ ? What's your API key? 🔒
$ ? What's your API secret? 🔒
```

Now, you're good to go!

```sh-session
$ Your config has been generated! 🚀
```

> Note: Your API key and secret can be found on the [Stream Dashboard](https://getstream.io/dashboard) and is specific to your application.
