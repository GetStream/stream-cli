# Stream CLI

---
> ## üö® **Breaking changes in v1.0 <**
> We have completely rewritten the Node.JS CLI to Go in 2022 Q1. Some of the changes:
> - The installation process is easier since it doesn't have any prerequisites (such as NPM). You can just simply download the executable and run it.
> - The name of the executable is `stream-cli` instead of `stream` to avoid conflicts with an existing tool ([imagemagick](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-cli/issues/33)). But you can rename it if you want to.
> - The command invocation is `stream-cli chat [verb-noun] [args] [options]` instead of `stream [verb:noun] [args] [options]`. The most obvious change is using dash instead of colon. We also added the `chat` keyword to preserve domain for our other product [Feeds](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/).
> - The 1.0.0 Go version's feature set is matching the old one. But if you miss anything, feel free to open an issue.

Stream's Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to create and manage your [Stream](https://getstream.io) apps directly from the terminal. Currently, only Chat is supported; however, the ability to manage Feeds will be coming soon.

# üöÄ Getting Started

In order to initialize the CLI, it's as simple as:

![Stream](./assets/first_config.svg)

> Note: Your API key and secret can be found on the [Stream Dashboard](https://getstream.io/dashboard) and is specific to your organization.

# üö® Warning

We purposefully chose the executable name `stream-cli` to avoid conflict with another tool called [`imagemagick`](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) which [already has a `stream` executable](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-cli/issues/33). 

If you do not have `imagemagick` installed, it might be more comfortable to rename `stream-cli` to `stream`. Alternatively you can set up a symbolic link:

```shell
$ ln -s ~/Downloads/stream-cli /usr/local/bin/stream
$ stream --version
stream-cli version 1.0.0
```

# üî® Syntax

Basic commands use the following syntax:

```shell
$ stream-cli [chat|feeds] [command] [args] [options]
```

Example:

```shell
$ stream-cli chat get-channel -t messaging -i redteam
```

The `--help` keyword is available every step of the way. Examples:

```shell
$ stream-cli --help
$ stream-cli chat --help
$ stream-cli chat get-channel --help
```

# üí¨ Auto completion
We provide autocompletion for the most popular shells (PowerShell, Bash, ZSH, Fish).

```shell
$ stream-cli completion --help
```
